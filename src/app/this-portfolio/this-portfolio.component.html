            <p>This portfolio was made by me using Angular Framework with TypeScript during the spring-autumn time of
                2023.
            </p>
            <p>I made it my mission to learn some new techniques while doing the site, like for example using scss,
                angular
                animations, publishing this site to a real server, learning more about css and also improving some of my
                old
                projects which are displayed here on the site.</p>
